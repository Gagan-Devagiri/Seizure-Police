# Seizure Police

## Inspiration & introduction:

People who suffer from epilepsy often experience seizures which are the risk for their lives. Other people typically do not react or do not know how to behave and believe in myths such as putting the stick between the teeth. To prevent behaviour like this we decided to develop an app which will improve the safety of people with epilepsy and minimise the risk of complications. It is inconvenient for them to wear additional sensors, which are often really expensive, stuck to their entire body. So why not to use the sensor from the smartphone that they most of the time have with them?

First of all, we collected the data to distinguish between normal movements like walking, running, jumping and the epilepsy attack. Then we created the app which is sending the message to the emergency number with guideline how to behave set by the user of the phone if there is a high probability of epilepsy attack. Finally, we connected both functions. If the detection was accidentally initialized the user has few seconds to prevent the app from sending the message.
## Prerequisites:

To edit or reproduce the functionality of the app it is required to use Android Studio  or InteLLiJ idea and Android Phone version 4.0 or higher with gyroscope, acceleration and gravity sensors.
