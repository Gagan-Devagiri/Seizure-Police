# Seizure Police

## Inspiration & introduction:

People who suffer from epilepsy often expeirence seizures which are risk for their lives. Other people typically do not react or do not know how to behave and believe in myths such as putting stick between the teeth. To prevent behavior like this we decided to develope an app which will improve safety of people with epilepsy and minimise the risk of complications. It is inconvinient for them to wear additional sensors, which are often really expensive, sticked to their enitire body. So why not to use sensor from the smartphone that they most of the time have with them?

First of all, we collected the data to distinguish between normal movements like walking, running, jumping and the epilepsy attack. Then we created the app which is sending the message to the emergency number with guidline how to behave setted by the user of the phone if there is high probility of epilepsy attack. Finally, we connected both functions. If the detection was accidently initialized the user have few seconds to prevent app from sending the messege.
## Prerequisites:

To edit or reproduce the functionality of the app it is required to use Android Studio  or InteLLiJ idea and Android Phone version 4.0 or higher with gyroscope, acceleration and gravity sensors.
